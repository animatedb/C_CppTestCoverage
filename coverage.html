<h3>C_CppTestCoverage</h3>
<p>
This is a very cheap implementation of a code coverage tool for C or C++ that works pretty
well. It provides code coverage by instrumenting (modifying) the source code. 
</p><p>
It uses some cheap parsing, so may not well for some source code. It generally looks for
open braces, conditional statements, case and default statements. 
</p><p>
This code mainly works for C or C++ code where the statement is on a different
line than the open brace, so it works for some K&R, GNU, Whitesmiths, etc.
If the code has another style, it may have to be formatted first, or the
parser needs to be modified to split the brace.
</p><p>
The goal is very low impact to the program under test with no modification of the
logic of the program. It does this by keeping a table of counts, one count
for each path in the code. Each time a path is executed, a counter is incremented.
Paths are determined using braces or keywords. When the program is finished, it
can update the statistics count file with the incremented counter values.
The code is generally thread safe if an integer increment is atomic. If not, the
code can be easily modified.
</p><p>
The filenames are not kept in the table in order to reduce memory usage.
At the end of execution, a separate script is used to read the table and list the counts
along with filenames.

<h3>Download Python</h3>
<p/>
This requires Python.
<ul>
<li>Download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ or use your installer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p/>
The code coverage is performed in a few phases.
<ul>
<li>The code is instrumented and copied to another directory by running cCovInstr.py</li>
<li>The copied code is compiled</li>
<li>The code is run, and when the code finishes, will write an output file containing
hit counts for the instrumented lines</li>
<li>The statistics are displayed using cCovStats.py and the copied source code is
modified to contain hit counts for each instrumented line.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instrumentation</h3>
The cCovDefinitions.py source file has to be modified to target your source and output
project directories. The cCovInstr.py source file is used to instrument the source code.

<ul>
<li>Open a command console</li>
<li>Run the cCovInstr.py script file.</li>
</ul>

For each line that is instrumented, a macro is inserted that increments a particular
value in an array.  The macro is contained in the header file "coverage.h", and the
values in the array have a particular data type with a certain number of bits, so the
hit counts may wrap. This file can be modified for a higher or lower value hit counts,
depending on the amount of memory available. The file can also be modified to prevent
wrap at the cost of speed for each instrumented line. The "coverage.h" file is generated
by the cCovInstr.py file.

<p/>
A proper C or C++ parser is not used, so there are some syntax formats that may not be instrumented
properly.  For example an open brace in a comment or string literal can cause indent
brace problems. An error will display for any file where the number of opening and closing braces
are not equal, and the instrumented code can be compiled to find the error.
A single statement with no braces after a conditional will not be instrumented if
the conditional spans multiple lines. An attempt is made to prevent instrumentation
of initialization of data in braces. For this to work properly, the brace or statememt should be on the
line after the keyword.

Lines that are inside of a #ifdef will also be instrumented, so this may lower the coverage
percentage.  To prevent lines in a certain ifdef or in comments from being instrumented, it is
possible to use "//" at the beginning of a line.

<h3>Execution</h3>
Follow the steps described in cCovDefinitions.py.

<h3>Statistics</h3>
The cCovStats.py source file is used to analyze the output from the program under test.

<ul>
<li>Open a command console</li>
<li>Run the cCovStats.py script file</li>
</ul>

Coverage statistics are displayed for each source file and all files, but they are the percent coverage
of instrumented code lines, which is not the same as percent coverage of total lines. It is
closer to the percentage of covered paths.
<p/>
An output file is generated for each file that shows the number of hits for each insrumented
line of code.  It is possible to find non-executed code by searching for "// 0"
<p/>
Since it is possible to read the instrumented code, it is possible to delete or comment
out problem instrumentation code, but no hits will be generated, so may lower the coverage percentage.
